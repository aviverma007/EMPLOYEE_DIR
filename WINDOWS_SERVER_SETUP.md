# Windows Server Setup Guide - PERMANENT FIXES

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### ‚úÖ 1. IMAGE UPLOAD PERSISTENCE - FIXED

**Problem**: Images were being erased on server restart/refresh
**Root Cause**: Upload directory was not properly configured for Windows persistence

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- Enhanced upload directory creation with proper permissions
- Added timestamp-based filenames to prevent conflicts
- Improved file permission settings for Windows compatibility

**For Your Windows Server**:
```bash
# Create persistent upload directory
mkdir backend\uploads\images

# Make sure the directory has write permissions
# On Windows, ensure your user account has full control over this folder
```

### ‚úÖ 2. MISSING FEATURES - RESTORED

**Problem**: Policies, Attendance, Meeting Rooms pages disappeared
**Solution**: Added them back as "More Features" dropdown while keeping the main 5-tab structure

**NEW NAVIGATION STRUCTURE**:
- **Main Tabs**: Home, Employee Directory, Work, Knowledge, Help
- **More Features Dropdown**: Policies, Workflows, Meeting Rooms, Attendance

## üõ†Ô∏è SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR WINDOWS SERVER

### 1. **Ensure Persistent Directories**
```cmd
cd C:\EmployeeDirectoryServer\EMPLOYEE_DIR\backend
mkdir uploads\images
# Grant full permissions to this folder
```

### 2. **Backend Configuration**
```cmd
# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify et_xmlfile is installed
pip list | findstr et_xmlfile

# Start backend
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

### 3. **Frontend Configuration**
Update `frontend\.env`:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

If accessing from other machines, replace `localhost` with your server IP:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8001
```

### 4. **Start Frontend**
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## üéØ FEATURES NOW AVAILABLE

### **Main Navigation (5 Tabs)**:
1. **Home** - Daily news and announcements
2. **Employee Directory** - Browse employees with hierarchy
3. **Work** - Task management and assignment
4. **Knowledge** - Company information and articles
5. **Help** - Support messaging with replies

### **Additional Features (More Features Dropdown)**:
- **Policies** - Company policies and procedures
- **Workflows** - Process management
- **Meeting Rooms** - Room booking system
- **Attendance** - Employee attendance tracking

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Images Still Don't Persist**:
1. Check folder permissions on `backend\uploads\images`
2. Ensure your user account has write access
3. Try running backend as administrator if needed
4. Check Windows firewall/antivirus isn't blocking file creation

### **If Pages Are Missing**:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all component files exist in `frontend\src\components\`

### **Database Issues**:
- The system uses MongoDB for data persistence
- Images are saved to filesystem but URLs stored in database
- If database is cleared, image URLs will be lost but files remain
